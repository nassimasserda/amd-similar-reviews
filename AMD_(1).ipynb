            "|17155|17458|1.0               |This summer we read this book. I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

In business, he buys at the wrong time and sells at the wrong time. In relationships, he is cold when his nearest and dearest wish to be close to him, and then seeks them out after it is too late.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

Asimov hooks you with a flawless story-line and personable characters, and reels you in with superb twists and turns and a way of resolving things that is limited to only his intellect. His visions of the future are as or more astounding then Orson Well's and his story-telling ability ranks among the best. It might be a &quot;Seldon&quot; crisis if you don't read this book.

            "|29783|29784|1.0               |Although many people view Of Mice and Men as a classic, there are some who disagree. The novel was banned and challenged in many schools throughout the country because of explicit language and profanity. After finishing the book myself, I strongly disagree. The language used in Of Mice and Men is nothing new, and most definitely not something that teenagers have not already heard before. One of the characters, Crooks, who happens to be an African American, is quite often referred to in the novel as inferior and is treated much differently than the other characters in the novel. That is perhaps another reason why people may have challenged the novel. Personally, I feel that Of Mice and Men positively contributes to the literary world because of its status. Many critics feel that it is a classic and I feel it should be treated as such. The idea of companionship is demonstrated throughout the book, and I feel that is a positive force. As shown in the novel, everyone needs someone to talk to, one cannot go throughout life without friends to confide in and have fun with. Overall, Of Mice and Men is a classic novel that everyone should read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

New mathematical ideas are introduced gently (so naturally, in fact, that the reader does not feel that (s)he is being asked to learn some new things!) and blended into the key Physical concepts.The book accelerates through a whole lot of material and tacitly introduces the reader to Maxwell's Equations without calling them so. Only after all of the core physical concepts - Dielectrics, Steady Currents and Magnetic Fields, Ferromagnetism, Electromagnetism/Induction - have been covered, do the authors venture to integrate the mathematics into Maxwell's equations. This emphasis on the Physics (with the Mathematics working merely as a tool) works really well and is central to the readability of this book.The latter chapters explore Transmission Lines, Electromagnetic Waves (which the mathematically inclined texts like to boast about as solutions of Maxwell's Equations), and the beginnings of Relativistic Electrodynamics.All in all, an excellent, enjoyable book - highly recommended!

            "|7892 |8156 |0.9436619718309859|I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.|\n",
